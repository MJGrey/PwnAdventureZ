# Pwn Adventure Z

## Players Guide

Welcome to the Pwn Adventure Z player's guide. Pwn Adventure Z was written to be a "hackable" game. It was designed with several challenges built into it that required reverse engineering and exploitation, but it was also meant to be a fun game in its own right. Here's a quick overview to give you a sense of the gameplay.

Pwn Adventure Z is a modern take on an old platform. Designed as a zombie survival game with crafting and RPG elements, it's built for the original NES.

At the start of the game, you'll begin in a cave with a simple teasure chest (`A` to open it), and inside you'll find a trusty axe. You'll need to equip the axe (`SELECT`, then `A`) and then read the note next to it (`A`). It tells you to hurry to town where you'll find more out about what has befallen your home town.

Along the way you'll battle a variety of enemies. Most will drop items that you'll have to retrieve before you get them, though any enemies in water (like sharks) will simply deposit the items directly into your inventory when killed.

You can see a map of area you've explored with the `START` button.

## Crafting / Salvaging

A variety of items can only be made via crafting -- using the `LEFT` and `RIGHT` arrow keys inside the inventory screen will allow these other menus. The crafting menu allows you to make new items from ingredients you've found or purchased, and the salvage menu allows you to break down some items back into their ingredients.

## The Goal

The goal of the game is to kill patient zero, the first zombie. He resides in a laboratory toward the middle of the map, but you won't be able to enter the lab until you've first retrieved the six keys that the door is locked with.

Each of the six keys is spread out on the map and in a horde chest. Each horde chest requires defeating a set number of enemies. The type of enemies is determined by the chest location, while the number of enemies depends on which chest (1-6), and what difficulty level (normal, hard, and apocalypse). Once all the enemies have been killed, the chest will unlock and the player will receive the chest key and some items. The number of chest keys obtained is shown on the main game screen in the lower-right hand corner, not as a specific item in the inventory. 

## Shops

There are three shops in the game. Inside each shop are shopkeepers who sell and buy different items. If you're looking to sell a specific item you've found and one shopkeeper doesn't accept it, try another.

## Difficulty

The game starts on normal difficulty. If you want to jump straight to Hard, use the name "QUEST 2.0" as your username, or you can use "UNBEARABLE" and go straight to Apocalypse mode. Both of those difficulties are totally different maps and all the enemies are much more difficult. For casual players or those just trying to get a feel for the game quickly, normal is the recommended difficulty.

## Keys

	A - Select, or fire
	B - Currently unused in the normal view--in buying, crafting, salvaging, etc it acts as a faster version of A
	START - Map
	SELECT - Inventory
	U,D,L,R - Up, Down, Left, Right should behave as you'd expect
