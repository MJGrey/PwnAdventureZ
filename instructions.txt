= Pwn Adventure Z =

Welcome to Pwn Adventure Z! The latest iteration of the Pwn Adventure Series (http://pwnadventure.com/).

This original Nintendo game was originally written for the CSAW security capture-the-flag contest in November, 2015. (https://ctf.isis.poly.edu/).

For Awesome Games Done Quick 2016, it's been customized as a competition between manual speed runners and TASers!

Included in this zip file are:

	instructions.txt - You're reading me!
	PwnAdventureZ.nes - The ROM itself
	PwnAdventureZ.nes.*.nl - FCEUX symbol files (also readable by Binary Ninja: http://binary.ninja)
	PwnAdventureZ.map - An symbol map file created by the compiler (same information as the FCEUX symbol files)
	PwnAdventureZ.html - Just for funsies, a JavaScript emulator we wrote too. 

= Differences = 
The differences between the AGDQ version and the previously released version are as follows:
	1) The "secret code" was removed (it was enabled for the purpose of the CTF)
	2) The random code was /too/ random. Requiring frame perfect control for all drops is a bit hard on humans. Now the random seed is controlled based on your path through the map (though entering a room at a different spot in an opening can offset it slightly by causing zombies to move their spawn location.
	3) AGDQ Logo!

You can verify these changes yourself if you like in the source code as mentioned below.

If you're creating a speed run, you'll probably want to check out these writeups describing some of the (intentional) flaws that can be used to glitch the game to great effect:
