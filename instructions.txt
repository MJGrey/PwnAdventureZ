= Pwn Adventure Z =

Welcome to Pwn Adventure Z! The latest iteration of the Pwn Adventure Series (http://pwnadventure.com/).

This original Nintendo game was originally written for the Computer Security Awareness Week (CSAW) capture-the-flag contest in November, 2015. (https://ctf.isis.poly.edu/).

For Awesome Games Done Quick 2016, it's been customized as a competition between human speedrunners and TASers!
Included in this zip file are:

	instructions.txt - You're reading me!
	PwnAdventureZ.nes - The ROM itself
	PwnAdventureZ.nes.*.nl - FCEUX symbol files (also readable by Binary Ninja: http://binary.ninja)
	PwnAdventureZ.map - A symbol map file created by the compiler (same information as the FCEUX symbol files)
	PwnAdventureZ.html - Just for funsies, a JavaScript emulator we wrote too. 

= Differences = 
Several changes have been made for this AGDQ 2016 version compared to the original CSAW 2015 CTF contest version:
	1) The "secret code" has been removed
	2) The RNG was changed to determine drops solely based on the order rooms are entered, not the far more random system used in the CSAW build as it would have required constant frame-perfect control.
	3) Some aspects of the game mechanics have been rebalanced based on feedback from beta testers
	4) The soundtrack from fuzyll has been updated (available for download at )
	5) Startup screens customized for GDQ 

You can verify these changes yourself if you like in the source code as mentioned below.

If you're creating a speedrun, please check out these writeups describing some of the flaws (intentional and otherwise) that can be used to beat the game quickly. You're welcome to look for more, but in the interests of time, it's probably best to use these. The two main approaches are a total control / code execution bug that can be used to jump straight to the credits, and a warp/spawn glitch that lets you jump straight to the final boss.

= Map Data =

To help you in your run, you may find it useful to view map data. First, get the source code as described in the next section.

Next, open levels.inc in your favorite text editor, and copy the ".byte" lines under the section you are interested in ("normal_overworld_map", or "normal_sewer_map", or "normal_mine_map", for example).

Finally, open mapcreator.html in a browser (tested with Chrome but should work with others as well), and paste in the data from levels.inc. When you click "load", you should see what the stored map data corresponds to.
